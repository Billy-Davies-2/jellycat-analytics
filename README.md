# Jellycat Analytics

Jellycat analytics is my analytics platform for how to calculate sentiments towards a jellycat.

## What you need

- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Apache Flink
- ClickHouse
- NATs

Kubernetes is preferred.

### What I might add

- docker compose for local testing
- transformers? I'm sure I can make these analytics better.
